      <p class="sectiontitle">INTRODUCTION</p>
      <h4 class="sectiondesc">Hi, I'm Dan.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">I'm a 16 year old from Ballymena, Northern Ireland 🇬🇧 🇮🇪.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">I'm currently in my GCSE stage of British secondary education, where I'm taking exam
        classes in Business & Communication Systems, Digital Technology, Double-Award Science, English Literature, Further Mathematics
        and Geography, alongside the compulsory Mathematics (M4+M8), English Language and Religious Studies.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">In the near future I hope to continue my education journey through a Level 3 Extended Diploma in Computing / Software Engineering (or A-levels), and
       studying at university in Finland - where I'm planning to immigrate to (as soon as possible) when I become an adult. I'm interested in both software development and cyber-security, and I'm
       considering a job in either one of these fields.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Since creating my first basic HTML website at age 7, I've been dedicated to improving my
        skills with developing websites, apps, APIs and pretty much anything that interests me - nothing is too big of a
        challenge to even try!

      <h4 class="sectiondesc">Languages, Kielet, Språk.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">At age 10 in 2015, I began to learn my first non-English language: Icelandic 🇮🇸.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Since then, especially leading into 2019, I've attempted to learn many languages from
        countries all around the world, especially the Nordic region and western Europe.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">As of August 2021, I'm primarily focusing on Finnish 🇫🇮 [<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels">A2</a>], but I'm also conversational [<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels">B2</a>]
        in Norwegian 🇳🇴 (meaning I can understand mutally intelligable Swedish 🇸🇪 and Danish 🇩🇰), although I hope to begin learning Swedish on its own soon.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">
      I'm also planning on learning Estonian 🇪🇪, Faroese 🇫🇴, Greenlandic 🇬🇱, Japanese 🇯🇵, Russian 🇷🇺 and Ukranian 🇺🇦 (when I have the time – I already have the textbooks!)
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">My childhood spent playing Minecraft or Roblox online with strangers from across the
        globe has hugely contributed to my love and great interest in many cultures, countries, and their languages.

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Ever since 2014, I've been creating and editing YouTube videos for <a
          href="https://youtube.com/dandabsMC">my channel</a>.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">This love of directing, editing and scriptwriting for videos and productions has stuck
        with me to this day. Throughout the years, I've been tasked with the production of many professional videography
        projects; each of these winning a total of almost £1000 through competitions.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">With the implementation of very high quality point-and-shoot cameras in iPhones, I've
        been able to really improve my photography skillset and take some phenomenal photos - something that just
        wouldn't have been possible a few years ago.</p>

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Ever since my mum told me that websites are made with code, in the car on the way home from school in 2012, I've been hooked.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Throughout the last 9 years, I've been making different random applications and websites, most of which serve no great purpose – but at least it's something!
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">
      I code in a variety of different languages and frameworks; different projects have different specifications and requirements, so I just learn whatever it needs and move on.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">In recent months I've also been working on commisioned projects for people, or working on projects with friends (either through TS or Git), which has taught me how to work on coding projects in a team, as hard as it may be.

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">7 years ago I sat down with an online friend and created a Minecraft server.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Over these years, I've worked with hundreds of other people, managed a large team
        of staff and developed custom server software - from the start, CloudCraft has been a team project. I also
        recently oversaw the production of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JKKYSpyzGI">anniversary
          ceremony</a>, which was premiered in November 2020.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">This Minecraft server has given me the chance to build a community from the ground up,
        connecting people from many countries and making friends for life, while also improving my leadership skills by
        having to deal with problems when something goes wrong.

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Getting accepted into HC's crew was one of my highlights of 2020.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">In December 2019, I wrote an application for one of Finland's largest Roblox
        cruise-ferry
        groups (which recieved feedback such as "this is the best application ever"!). Almost a year later, I've
        progressed
        through the staff ranks - from standard crew, to developer, to my last role as a manager!
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Helsinki Cruises is a ~1500 member group and, since joining there I've quickly made
        myself
        part of the HC family, and began helping passengers with many sorts of queries and issues.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">My experience here has taught me how to deal with working with / helping people that I
        don't
        get along well with, while still getting high customer satisfaction - many people have told me that they always
        remembered me after cruises (for all the good reasons!).

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Working at MK Cruises <i>really</i> tested my patience.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">With the COVID-19 pandemic leading the majority of the world into lockdown, MK Cruises
        came
        along just at the right time. Making friends with the CEO of the company, shortly aftering joining the group, I
        became
        a manager, and shortly thereafter one of MK's executive officers.

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Between handing out free samples of Goat Cheese Salad, having such a senior role at this

        developed my leadership skills - dealing with the team of staff, relaying important information to group
        members, and
        helped to resolve internal altercations.

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Vedemo was my first experience with game development.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">In early 2020, I teamed up with a Finnish friend of mine to create Vedemo Studios,
        a computer-game development company/group.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">During my time at Vedemo, we both experimented with multiple game development engines,
        such as Unity, UE4 and Roblox Studio. Shortly after making the group, we began to develop multiple space-related
        games, the first one being known as "Spacelab".
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Even though my experience with Vedemo Studios didn't last long, it was a very interesting
        few months - I made myself familiar with game development, completed server administration tasks to host APIs and
        our website at the time, and also worked on building a loyal playerbase and gathering interest for our games.

      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Shortly after my beginning to secondary school in 2017, I met a group of people who were 
        looking for a place to record their Minecraft roleplay series - by letting them use my Minecraft server to film,
        I got myself into one of the biggest projects I've ever been involved in.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent convert-emoji">Throughout the years CSRP existed, I worked in our small team of 6 people to write scripts
        for each episode of the series, and worked on filming, editing and producing the videos, audio and voiceovers which
        were required for each episode to be successful.
