      <h4 class="sectiondesc">Hi, I'm Dan.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent">I'm a 15 year old from Country Antrim, in Northern Ireland 🇬🇧.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">I'm currently in my GCSE stage of British secondary education, where I'm taking exam
        classes in Business & Communication Systems, Digital Technology, Double-Award Science, English Language + Literature, Further Mathematics and Geography.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">In the near future I hope to continue my education journey through A-levels, and
        possibly studying at university in either Finland or Norway - where I want to immigrate to when I'm an adult.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">Since creating my first basic HTML website at age 7, I've been dedicated to improving my
        skills with developing websites, apps, APIs and pretty much anything that interests me - nothing is too big of a
        challenge to even try!

      <h4 class="sectiondesc">Languages, Kielet, Språk.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent">In 2015, I began to learn my first non-English language: Icelandic 🇮🇸.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">Since then, especially leading into 2019, I've attempted to learn many languages from
        countries all around the world, especially the Nordic region and western Europe.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">As of December 2020, I'm conversational [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels">B2</a>] in Norwegian 🇳🇴 (meaning I can understand basic [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels">B1</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels">A2</a>]
        Swedish 🇸🇪 and Danish 🇩🇰!) and I'm primarily focusing on Finnish 🇫🇮 [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels">A1</a>]. I'm still considering what languages I will
        pick up next, but for now I have my eye set on Lithuanian 🇱🇹 and Japanese 🇯🇵!</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">My childhood spent playing Minecraft or Roblox online with strangers from across the
        globe has hugely contributed to my love and great interest in many cultures, countries, and their languages.

      <p class="sectioncontent">Ever since 2014, I've been creating and editing YouTube videos for <a
          href="https://youtube.com/dandabsMC">my channel</a>.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">This love of directing, editing and scriptwriting for videos and productions has stuck
        with me to this day. Throughout the years, I've been tasked with the production of many professional videography
        projects; each of these winning a total of almost £1000 through competitions.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">With the implementation of very high quality point-and-shoot cameras in iPhones, I've
        been able to really improve my photography skillset and take some phenomenal photos - something that just
        wouldn't have been possible a few years ago.</p>

      <h4 class="sectiondesc">CloudCraft SMP.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent">7 years ago I sat down with an online friend and created a Minecraft server.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">Over these years, I've worked with hundreds of other people, managed a large team
        of staff and developed custom server software - from the start, CloudCraft has been a team project. I also
        recently oversaw the production of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JKKYSpyzGI">anniversary ceremony</a>, which was premiered in November 2020.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">This Minecraft server has given me the chance to build a community from the ground up,
        connecting people from many countries and making friends for life, while also improving my leadership skills by
        having to deal with problems when something goes wrong.

      <h4 class="sectiondesc">Helsinki Cruises.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent">Getting accepted into HC's crew was one of my highlights of 2020.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">In December 2019, I wrote an application for one of Finland's largest Roblox cruise-ferry
        groups (which recieved feedback such as "this is the best application ever"!). Almost a year later, I've progressed
        through the staff ranks - from standard crew, to developer, to my current role as a manager!
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">Helsinki Cruises is a ~1500 member group and, since joining there I've quickly made myself
        part of the HC family, and began helping passengers with many sorts of queries and issues.
      </p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">My experience here has taught me how to deal with working with / helping people that I don't
        get along well with, while still getting high customer satisfaction - many people have told me that they always
        remembered me after cruises (for all the good reasons!).<p>

      <h4 class="sectiondesc">MK Cruises.</h4>
      <p class="sectioncontent">Working at MK Cruises <i>really</i> tested my patience.</p>
      <p class="sectioncontent">With the COVID-19 pandemic leading the majority of the world into lockdown, MK Cruises came
        along just at the right time. Making friends with the CEO of the company, shortly aftering joining the group, I became
        a manager, and shortly thereafter one of MK's executive officers.

      <p class="sectioncontent">Between handing out free samples of Goat Cheese Salad, having such a senior role at this group
        developed my leadership skills - dealing with the team of staff, relaying important information to group members, and
        helped to resolve internal altercations.
